What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates hidden files, these files help git in order to track version control. 
	If you don't initialize a repository then you canÂ´t use version control. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is like an intermediary between a working directory and the repository, it helps us to commit only those files important for us, at least in that specific period of time.
