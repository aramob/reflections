When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  	When you are going to work on a collaborative project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Branches: are different versions of the same repository withc have significant differences. 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Merging changes is way more difficult. It is harder to get approved if your team is not available.
